# Portfolio Site

## Purpose
The purpose of the website is to display a portfolio advertising personal skills. The portfolio contains an abouts page with information about me and my brief description on my skills and past projects. The portfolio page will display images cards with the titles of the projects I have completed. The blogs page displays five blogs with links to each blogs page. The contacts page will contain contact information and a form for visiters to fill out in order to contact me.

## Functionality / Features

### Colours: 
- The colours that are used through-out the site where choosen to convey a calm, natural aesthetic. The colours don't overwhelm the viewer and work coherently together. The colours of the web-pages through-out the site change to portray to the viewer that they are on a different page, yet the colours are all familiar. This conveys that you are on the same site, but there is a visual difference to keep the viewer engaged. The three colours are the only ones beside the black text that are used to aid in achieving this. 

### Header: 
- The header contains a bamboo icon that leads back to the home page along with links to the 'About', 'Portfolio', 'Blogs' and 'Contact' page. The header has a large border-radius that makes it smooth. This adds the the calm and natural aesthetic by avioding shape edges through-out the web-site. Once a link has been visited it will also turn a different colour to aid the viewer in thier navigation of the website.

### Footer: 
- The footer contains links to GitHub, LinkedIn and Instagram. The footer is designed to be shorter than the header since there is less information to be displayed. The colour of the footer depends on the back-ground color of the web page. Similar to the header, the footer has a large border-radius that makes it smooth. This adds the the calm and natural aesthetic by avioding shape edges through-out the web-site.

### Home Page:

### About Page:

### Projects Page:
- The Projects page consists of four projects. An image and heading is used to display them. The background colour for this web-page is darker and was used to display the Project image/heading cards so they are more clearer on the screen. This also helps break up the web-site, but still bringing coherency by using the three main colours of the site. The header and footer where also changed to achieve this.

### Blogs Page:
- 

### Contacts Page:
- Contacts page contains a form that invites people to send a message. The page also contains contact information and a call to 'Get in Touch', which further invited people to get in contact for work or for questions.

### Animations:
- Animations are used in the header and footer. The size will gradually change when minimizing the screen. This is to make the transition between the sizes smoother.
- When hovering over the links in the header it will enlarge. This is to emphasize that it is a link to another page. Since there is no underline under the links, the hover animation makes it clearer to the viewer. This is displayed on all pages of the web-site.
